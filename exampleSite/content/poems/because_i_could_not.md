Because I could not stop for Death,\\
He kindly stopped for me;\\
The carriage held but just ourselves\\
And Immortality.

We slowly drove, he knew no haste,\\
And I had put away\\
My labor, and my leisure too,\\
For his civility.

We passed the school, where children strove\\
At recess, in the ring;\\
We passed the fields of gazing grain,\\
We passed the setting sun.

Or rather, he passed us;\\
The dews grew quivering and chill,\\
For only gossamer my gown,\\
My tippet only tulle.

We paused before a house that seemed\\
A swelling of the ground;\\
The roof was scarcely visible,\\
The cornice but a mound.

Since then 'tis centuries, and yet each\\
Feels shorter than the day\\
I first surmised the horses' heads\\
Were toward eternity.
